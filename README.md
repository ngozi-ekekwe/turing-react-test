## Folder Structure
All the components are located in `src/Components`. Each component is placed in its own folder (e.g `Home` folder for `Home` component). All secondary/supporting components are contained in the same folder as their parent component. However, `Timestamp` and `Loading` are used multiple over several components and as such can be found in the `Extra` folder under `Components`.
<br>

Each file exports ONLY ONE component. <br>
CamelCase is the primary naming convention for methods while underscores are used for data (variables) retrieved from the server.
